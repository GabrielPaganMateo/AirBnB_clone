# Holberton School AirBnB Clone

This repository contains the project files for AirBnB clone project, which is a part of the Holberton School curriculum. At the moment, the goal of this project is to build a command-line interface (**The Console**) that can create, update, and delete objects. After this, we'll create:

- A **website** (*front-end*) that shows the final product to everybody;
- A **database** or files that store data;
- An **API** that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data.

## What’s The Console?

Is a command line interpreter like the Shell, but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we are able to manage objects in our storage system (JSON file):

- Create a new object (ex a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

The Console is the tool to validate this storage engine


## Getting Started with The Console

To use The Console you need to clone this repository to your local machine, using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/GabrielPaganMateo/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git

Finally, you can execute The Console using the following command:

    ./console.py

## How to use The Console?

After executing The Console, you can use it with the following commands:

    help: displays a list of available commands.
    quit: exits the program.
    create: creates a new object and saves it to a JSON file.
    show: displays the details of an existing object.
    destroy: deletes an existing object.
    all: displays a list of all existing objects.
    update: updates the attributes of an existing object.
